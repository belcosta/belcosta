# Isabel Costa

On 23.01.2021 I am finishing a one year intensive course about Web Development, with focus on MERN Projects. 

My next career step, is to find a company where I can bring my fresh knowledge and gain experience as a web developer.

**Please keep visiting my github page, new projects are added as I complete them.**


I am looking forward to hear from you.
